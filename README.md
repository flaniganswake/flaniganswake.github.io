## Bio

At the start of my career I was a researcher at the University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign. I was a technical lead and architect for the Software Development Group at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). While there I developed an innovative distributed computing system called Symera. It leveraged network services to build dynamic, decentralized clusters as well as support libraries for porting legacy applications. I presented Symera to Microsoft as a possible replacement for their Wolfpack clustering solution. After leaving NCSA I worked for a handful of startups including an interactive, mentor-based educational company called Useractive. Here I built a web browser terminal emulator by rewriting PuTTY as a COM control, a lightweight XML-based desktop event recording system called MacroMentor, and SafePassage - an SSH-tunneling client. Useractive was acquired by O'Reilly Publishing. I then spent three years at NCSA as a network security engineer. My work focused upon Mithril - an intrusion detection and response system. I also completed research work with Software Defined Radio (SDR). Later I designed a real-time distributed performance monitoring system for Sears which handled approximately 2000 business servers. My most current position was with a Finnish company called Swap.com. I was the lead backend engineer at the warehouse in Chicago. My work included innovative UI development for merchandising, designing the shipping workflow software and building a production training and testing environment. I have always gravitated towards challenging, innovative work. I enjoy creative, collaborative environments which aspire to build exceptional software solutions.
